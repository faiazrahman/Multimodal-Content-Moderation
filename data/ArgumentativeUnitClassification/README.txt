This is where the combined, preprocessed data from the AMPERSAND and Stab & Gurevych argument mining datasets will be stored, as `all_auc_data.tsv` (in a tab-separated text file) and `auc_dataframe.pkl` (as a pandas DataFrame saved via Python's `pickle` module).

This is generated by `argument_mining/data_preprocessing.py` and is used to train the argumentative unit classification submodel for argument graph construction. `auc_dataframe.pkl` is used directly by the dataloaders for the argumentative unit classification submodel.
