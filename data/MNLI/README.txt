Run the `download_data.sh` shell script to download the data from its URL and unzip it.

```
bash download_data.sh
```

This will create a subdirectory `multinli_1.0`, in which the data will then be available as both a json and a text file. We will use `multinli_1.0_train.txt`.

The first line in the file is the header, which has the following column names (in order):
    gold_label
    sentence1_binary_parse
    sentence2_binary_parse
    sentence1_parse
    sentence2_parse
    sentence1
    sentence2
    promptID
    pairID
    genre
    label1
    label2
    label3
    label4
    label5

Thus, we will only use 'sentence1', 'sentence2', and 'gold_label'.

For reference, here are the first few lines of `multinli_1.0_train.txt`:

gold_label      sentence1_binary_parse  sentence2_binary_parse  sentence1_parse sentence2_parse sentence1       sentence2       promptID        pairID  genre   label1  label2  label3  label4  label5
