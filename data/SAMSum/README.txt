Run the `download_data.sh` shell script to download the data from its URL and unzip it.
When it asks "Would you like to replace the existing file: ...", type in N (for no).

```
bash download_data.sh
```

Notes
- The data is stored as a 7zip file (with extension `.7z`), so we use the `7za`
  Linux command to uncompress it (with the `e` flag, for "extract")
- We have to pass a user agent to `wget`, otherwise it fails with 403 Forbidden
  error (likely because the site thinks that a bot, etc. is trying to access
  the data)
- If your Linux distribution does not have the 7za command, you can install it;
  if that fails, you can directly download the data from the link
  https://arxiv.org/src/1911.12237v2/anc/corpus.7z
  and move the `train.json`, `test.json`, and `val.json` files manually into
  this directory

## Dataset
The SAMSum dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. Conversations were created and written down by linguists fluent in English. Linguists were asked to create conversations similar to those they write on a daily basis, reflecting the proportion of topics of their real-life messenger convesations. The style and register are diversified - conversations could be informal, semi-formal or formal, they may contain slang words, emoticons and typos. Then, the conversations were annotated with summaries. It was assumed that summaries should be a concise brief of what people talked about in the conversation in third person.
The SAMSum dataset was prepared by Samsung R&D Institute Poland and is distributed for research purposes (non-commercial licence: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
